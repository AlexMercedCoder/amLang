# amLang
### Spec by Alex Merced of AlexMercedCoder.com

This document is to detail the specifications for amLang, a programming language based
on my experience with different languages and how a more developer friendly language may look
like borrowing from many of other languages.

## Implementation

This programming language is currently just the specifications in these documents but overtime I hope
to implement this language by either compiling to WebAssembly or transpiling to Javascript. If you are
interested in seeing an implementation of this language I encourage you to create one.

## Basic Features

- Dynamic Typing (similar to javascript)
- Tab based syntax (similar to python)
- Dynamic loops (no for, no while, just loop with different constructors)
- array and associative arrays (similar to PHP)
- The ability to use operators in between values like OOP languages and before values like lisp
